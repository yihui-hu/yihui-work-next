<hr />

In October 2023, I was in the process of learning SwiftUI, and thinking of what to build as I went along. [Are.na](https://are.na)'s mobile app came to mind – it had always felt a little slow and buggy from my and other users' experience.

It's built with React Native, which is known to be less performant than native solutions, with more compatibility issues as well. So I found myself thinking that this could be a good opportunity to build a new, native iOS app for Are.na with SwiftUI.

I call it Are:na, which you can download [here](https://testflight.apple.com/join/pn2mkLJ0). You can also read a more in-depth case study of this app [here](https://yihuihu.com/arena).
