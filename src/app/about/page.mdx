Hello! I'm Yihui. I'm from Singapore, currently wrapping up my senior year as a Computer Science major at Tufts University.

I enjoy working on early-stage software and shared experiences on the web, building with polish and performance in mind.

In my free time, I continue to explore type, print, design and zine-making. You can view my CV [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O5RdirrU7IDvmsVPGWqLS91VsayWJtmD/view?usp=sharing).
